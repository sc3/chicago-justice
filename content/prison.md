### Summary  

Once someone is found guilty of a crime and sentenced to more to more than a year in jail, that person is transferred to one of the states' 66 facilities. These prisons are part to the Illinois Department of Corrections.

### Data Inventory  

The Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) allows you to search by last name, birth date, or inmate number to locate information regarding the status of a single inmate; this data is reported below.

#### Open Data

{{ inventory('prison', 'open') }}

#### FOIA Accessible Data

It is unclear to what extent IDOC is amenable to a FOI request. The Chicago Justice Project has filed a minimal request with them to see what kinds of data fields they collect, but they have not responded.

#### Unavailable Data

There is likely some prison data that would be unavailable, even from a FOIA request. The unavailable jail data might serve as a good reference point for understanding what kinds of fields are not accessible from a correctional institution.

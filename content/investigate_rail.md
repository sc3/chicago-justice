### National Models for Releasing Justice Data

##### City of Chicago (Illinois)  
[data.cityofchicago.org](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2)  

The City of Chicago's data portal provides excellent access to crime incident data that is either usable online or can be downloaded for later use. While the portal leads other cities in usability the Chicago Police Department only makes available crime incident data. [Henrico County](http://randolph.co.henrico.va.us/public-data-access/searcharrest.aspx), Virginia, makes arrest data available. This is the only source we have located that makes this data available online; however, while this data is searchable online you cannot download the data in bulk.

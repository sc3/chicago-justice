## Victimization  

### Summary  

All over Chicago, every day, in every corner of our oblong city, people commit crimes. This project seeks to index the data that document these crimes. We cover the collection of the voice of victims when they call 311, the daily notes of detectives who investigate crime, the material delivered to the court system when charges are filed, the records generated when convicts arrive in prison, and so on.

The documentation is immense. Some is published. Much of it is not. Our goal is to create a flat simple guide to what is known and what is not.

In each instance, this documentation process begins with a crime and ends with a dead end. That dead end could be a crime that goes unsolved, or a conviction, or dropped charges.

But the first dead end is the crime that goes unreported and undetected. There is no data around this, but there are formulas that estimate the amount of unreported crime.

### Summary

This office prosecutes crimes. Prosecutors work closely with the investigating agency, which includes Chicago Police, Cook County Sheriff's office among others. The lawyers take the case to determine what charges to file and whether there is enough evidence to prosecute the case, this is part of the Felony Review Unit. This unit alone has the authority to approve homicide charges; or, in cases involving juveniles, homicide charges or any lesser charge arising from the same occurrence (Not including drug or syndicated gambling charges).  


### Data Inventory

No information is available from the prosecutor's office about the data they routinely collect currently. I have a felony review folder where they collect information during the felony review process (link?) but it is now 4 years old. Also, it is not really clear what if any of this data ever makes it in to a database.

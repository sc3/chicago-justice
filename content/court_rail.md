The Maryland Courts website allows access to the most robust amount of data of any court we located. It lists what occurs in every court hearing while also detailing information regarding the officer that arrested the defendant, the prosecutor(s) prosecuting the case, and the judge presiding over the case. This site also details information regarding the defendant's lawyer. Not a single court would allow the bulk downloading of data involved in the cases.

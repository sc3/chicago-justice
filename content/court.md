### Data Inventory
###### Open Data
Publicly available online there is nothing. Some people, including journalists, who engage in protracted fights with the Circuit Clerk’s Office, can obtain data once Chief Judge Evans has approved your request. Our experience lasted 15 months and required a threat to file a lawsuit before they gave us the data we requested. 

###### FOIA Data
Directly from the courts nothing is available through the FOIA. The Courts are exempted from the FOIA requirements. It is unclear to what degree the Circuit Clerk’s Office, that maintains the Court’s data, is open to FOIA and would have to release the Court data.

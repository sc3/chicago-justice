### Data Inventory

The data inventory is a list of the information that's recorded by the Cook County Circuit Court for all the cases they hear. This inventory is different from the others in that it is divided into four categories:
<ol>
  <li>Data readily available,</li>
  <li>Data available through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, and</li>
  <li>Data that is collected but not available.</li>
</ol>
<br>

#### Open Data

The only publicly availble data is accessible in person.

#### FOIA Accessible Data

A judge has ruled that Court data is immune to FOIA requests. This may not apply equally to all units operating under the Court.

#### Requestable Data

Although there is no requirement for them to meet it, is possible to request any of the Court's data. Whether or not such requests will be satisfied is at the discretion of the Chief Judge of the Cook County Court, which is currently Judge Timothy Evans. The Chicago Justice Project was successful in requesting data about Convictions:

{{ inventory('court', 'requestable') }}

#### Unavailable Data

Because the Court approves data releases on a case by case basis, there is no set standards as to what data is and is not available.
